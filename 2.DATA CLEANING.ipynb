       "      <td>i have owned the momentum 2’s for many years and love them. but, after the battery started to fail and took over 8hrs to charge i decided to upgrade. here are my thoughts:sound - really good, but different to the 2’s. took some time to get used to but i really like the sound now.battery - amazing. 60 hours is huge and makes such a difference not having to charge so regularly.comfort - the 2’s were great but these are on another level. can wear for hours on end without getting hot or ever feeling uncomfortable.look - the 2’s looked amazing with the ivory colour. these look ok, but do not stand out. build quality is excellent. no creaking on mine.controls - i hate the touch controls and miss having a button to adjust the volume. if adjusting, then it is easy to activate a control. changing the volume is hit and miss. i have turned touch controls off as they are too unreliable. it would be good to switch just some of the controls off and just have volume, or have the ability to change via the app. maybe having less controls would help it work better.connectivity - multiple devices works fine. i’ve had no issues but it niggles me that when you connect, you get a lovely voice that tells you it has connected, but when you connect a  bluetooth device, a lady from essex tells you it is connected. it is so wierd they use different voices for different announcements.all in all a great pair of headphones but i wish sennheiser would address some minor niggles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>at first i felt these headphones were a mixed bag of tricks. i had read other reviewers had problems but having an earlier sennheiser model and being familiar with their app i hoped for the best. however it took ages to get going. the on off control is tricky - to get a bluetooth connection the on button must be pressed till the lights flash rapidly. it's also hard to tell if it's really switched off. i then had a nightmare trying to connect to the sennheiser app. my older set connects to both the app and bluetooth in seconds and works brilliantly but the momentum 4 took me the best part of an hour plus another thirty minutes to install a firmware update. the problem i had, i think, was i initially tried connecting using a fire10 tablet and the app just didn't like it. as a last attempt i tried the fire max 11 which worked at once. i then then downloaded the update by which time i had had enough electronics for one very stressful evening. the next morning i tried again with the fire 10 and all was well. it seems the update resolved issues connecting to the app but unless you have another device or can find another way to update it's frustrating. sennheiser do say their app is designed for phones primarily and do offer support with tablet related problems but in the event i didn't need to contact them. since that first attempt i have had absolutely no problems with connection at all on any of the three devices i use.the sennheiser sound is superb on the momentum 4. i very much like the sound check system which helps to establish your personal presets by offering several sets of three settings - you select your preferred out of each set. i like a wide range of music including jazz, opera, rock, metal and in a few minutes was able to save settings for each genre. i had done this before with my older sennheiser with great success but the sound on this newer set is brilliant. unlike other reviewers i like the app. once you find your way round it it's easy to use and the online manual is comprehensive and clearly written.there is only one button on the momentum 4 much to my relief - and as i have said that one needs a bit of learning to operate effectively. other controls are by touch and these work extremely well  - swipe up and down for volume, touch for stop start etc.  unless you are committed to buttons this is a great improvement. the set is extremely comfortable with a neat flat appearance. i have noticed no clicking or creaking noises and no heat to my ears. it stays connected even when i move around a lot and stops as soon as removed from the head. the case is well designed with room for cables and guidance notes.i have used the set for about 40 hours so far, battery is still 50% charged. noise cancellation is easy to adjust on the app or the headphone touch control and seems good although i am in a quiet room. i haven't tried a phone connection as i am in an area where mobile reception is appalling.overall i am very happy but more comprehensive guidance notes in the initial paperwork would have saved me a frustrating hour - but i say that about anything new!!if your primary wish is great sound at a medium price this is a wonderful buy. but be ready to take time to establish connections and don't miss the update.</td>\n",

       "      <td>i wasn’t sure how good these were going to be as iv not had a pair of wireless premium over ear cans before. i have been using apple airpods pro and found these to be very average with rubbish bass. i wanted some headphones that were comfortable, had an open sound but with good bass. not blast your ass off bass mind you, but bass that would be quality.set up was a little bit of a mixed bag and i had to faff about a bit at first, as it didn’t work first time. but it  was a smooth experience the second time around.sound quality is excellent once you tailor it to your taste. the sound is open and expansive and bass feels well controlled, deep and heavy in tracks where that is intended and gentle where it is not. so i really enjoy that it pounds to dance tracks and rumbles to pop and rnb. mids and highs are tight and clear. have not experienced any distortion at any volume.i would say that noise cancelling is ok. it’s not the best but not bad either. if this is critical for you, look elsewhere. there isn’t any pressure sensation you sometimes get- well not that i noticed anyway.the good? these are really light and comfortable and the sound is very very good with quality bass, mids and highs. a real highlight though is the battery; i have had these for a while now and only charged them fully once- which is brilliant. another thing i like is these have a great case.the bad? well, i have had a really mixed experience with connecting to the pc with the usb-c cable. it sometimes works but mostly doesn't. also, it can often repeatedly announce it is ‘connecting’ or ‘disconnecting’ which can get a little annoying. it’s seems to do this when you have multiple devices nearby. but that seems to have settled over the last few weeks and doesn’t happen as often as it used to.overall, for the price, i am really happy with these. they are quality. i have listened to the ridiculously priced apple airpods max and i think these sound better and are more comfortable. i can’t compare to sony mx5 as only listened to them once. i think you’ll be happy with these great headphones</td>\n",

       "1   at first i felt these headphones were a mixed bag of tricks. i had read other reviewers had problems but having an earlier sennheiser model and being familiar with their app i hoped for the best. however it took ages to get going. the on off control is tricky - to get a bluetooth connection the on button must be pressed till the lights flash rapidly. it's also hard to tell if it's really switched off. i then had a nightmare trying to connect to the sennheiser app. my older set connects to both the app and bluetooth in seconds and works brilliantly but the momentum 4 took me the best part of an hour plus another thirty minutes to install a firmware update. the problem i had, i think, was i initially tried connecting using a fire10 tablet and the app just didn't like it. as a last attempt i tried the fire max 11 which worked at once. i then then downloaded the update by which time i had had enough electronics for one very stressful evening. the next morning i tried again with the fire 10 and all was well. it seems the update resolved issues connecting to the app but unless you have another device or can find another way to update it's frustrating. sennheiser do say their app is designed for phones primarily and do offer support with tablet related problems but in the event i didn't need to contact them. since that first attempt i have had absolutely no problems with connection at all on any of the three devices i use.the sennheiser sound is superb on the momentum 4. i very much like the sound check system which helps to establish your personal presets by offering several sets of three settings - you select your preferred out of each set. i like a wide range of music including jazz, opera, rock, metal and in a few minutes was able to save settings for each genre. i had done this before with my older sennheiser with great success but the sound on this newer set is brilliant. unlike other reviewers i like the app. once you find your way round it it's easy to use and the online manual is comprehensive and clearly written.there is only one button on the momentum 4 much to my relief - and as i have said that one needs a bit of learning to operate effectively. other controls are by touch and these work extremely well  - swipe up and down for volume, touch for stop start etc.  unless you are committed to buttons this is a great improvement. the set is extremely comfortable with a neat flat appearance. i have noticed no clicking or creaking noises and no heat to my ears. it stays connected even when i move around a lot and stops as soon as removed from the head. the case is well designed with room for cables and guidance notes.i have used the set for about 40 hours so far, battery is still 50% charged. noise cancellation is easy to adjust on the app or the headphone touch control and seems good although i am in a quiet room. i haven't tried a phone connection as i am in an area where mobile reception is appalling.overall i am very happy but more comprehensive guidance notes in the initial paperwork would have saved me a frustrating hour - but i say that about anything new!!if your primary wish is great sound at a medium price this is a wonderful buy. but be ready to take time to establish connections and don't miss the update.   \n",

       "      <td>at first i felt these headphones were a mixed bag of tricks. i had read other reviewers had problems but having an earlier sennheiser model and being familiar with their app i hoped for the best. however it took ages to get going. the on off control is tricky - to get a bluetooth connection the on button must be pressed till the lights flash rapidly. it's also hard to tell if it's really switched off. i then had a nightmare trying to connect to the sennheiser app. my older set connects to both the app and bluetooth in seconds and works brilliantly but the momentum 4 took me the best part of an hour plus another thirty minutes to install a firmware update. the problem i had, i think, was i initially tried connecting using a fire10 tablet and the app just didn't like it. as a last attempt i tried the fire max 11 which worked at once. i then then downloaded the update by which time i had had enough electronics for one very stressful evening. the next morning i tried again with the fire 10 and all was well. it seems the update resolved issues connecting to the app but unless you have another device or can find another way to update it's frustrating. sennheiser do say their app is designed for phones primarily and do offer support with tablet related problems but in the event i didn't need to contact them. since that first attempt i have had absolutely no problems with connection at all on any of the three devices i use.the sennheiser sound is superb on the momentum 4. i very much like the sound check system which helps to establish your personal presets by offering several sets of three settings - you select your preferred out of each set. i like a wide range of music including jazz, opera, rock, metal and in a few minutes was able to save settings for each genre. i had done this before with my older sennheiser with great success but the sound on this newer set is brilliant. unlike other reviewers i like the app. once you find your way round it it's easy to use and the online manual is comprehensive and clearly written.there is only one button on the momentum 4 much to my relief - and as i have said that one needs a bit of learning to operate effectively. other controls are by touch and these work extremely well  - swipe up and down for volume, touch for stop start etc.  unless you are committed to buttons this is a great improvement. the set is extremely comfortable with a neat flat appearance. i have noticed no clicking or creaking noises and no heat to my ears. it stays connected even when i move around a lot and stops as soon as removed from the head. the case is well designed with room for cables and guidance notes.i have used the set for about 40 hours so far, battery is still 50% charged. noise cancellation is easy to adjust on the app or the headphone touch control and seems good although i am in a quiet room. i haven't tried a phone connection as i am in an area where mobile reception is appalling.overall i am very happy but more comprehensive guidance notes in the initial paperwork would have saved me a frustrating hour - but i say that about anything new!!if your primary wish is great sound at a medium price this is a wonderful buy. but be ready to take time to establish connections and don't miss the update.</td>\n",

       "1   at first i felt these headphones were a mixed bag of tricks. i had read other reviewers had problems but having an earlier sennheiser model and being familiar with their app i hoped for the best. however it took ages to get going. the on off control is tricky - to get a bluetooth connection the on button must be pressed till the lights flash rapidly. it's also hard to tell if it's really switched off. i then had a nightmare trying to connect to the sennheiser app. my older set connects to both the app and bluetooth in seconds and works brilliantly but the momentum 4 took me the best part of an hour plus another thirty minutes to install a firmware update. the problem i had, i think, was i initially tried connecting using a fire10 tablet and the app just didn't like it. as a last attempt i tried the fire max 11 which worked at once. i then then downloaded the update by which time i had had enough electronics for one very stressful evening. the next morning i tried again with the fire 10 and all was well. it seems the update resolved issues connecting to the app but unless you have another device or can find another way to update it's frustrating. sennheiser do say their app is designed for phones primarily and do offer support with tablet related problems but in the event i didn't need to contact them. since that first attempt i have had absolutely no problems with connection at all on any of the three devices i use.the sennheiser sound is superb on the momentum 4. i very much like the sound check system which helps to establish your personal presets by offering several sets of three settings - you select your preferred out of each set. i like a wide range of music including jazz, opera, rock, metal and in a few minutes was able to save settings for each genre. i had done this before with my older sennheiser with great success but the sound on this newer set is brilliant. unlike other reviewers i like the app. once you find your way round it it's easy to use and the online manual is comprehensive and clearly written.there is only one button on the momentum 4 much to my relief - and as i have said that one needs a bit of learning to operate effectively. other controls are by touch and these work extremely well  - swipe up and down for volume, touch for stop start etc.  unless you are committed to buttons this is a great improvement. the set is extremely comfortable with a neat flat appearance. i have noticed no clicking or creaking noises and no heat to my ears. it stays connected even when i move around a lot and stops as soon as removed from the head. the case is well designed with room for cables and guidance notes.i have used the set for about 40 hours so far, battery is still 50% charged. noise cancellation is easy to adjust on the app or the headphone touch control and seems good although i am in a quiet room. i haven't tried a phone connection as i am in an area where mobile reception is appalling.overall i am very happy but more comprehensive guidance notes in the initial paperwork would have saved me a frustrating hour - but i say that about anything new!!if your primary wish is great sound at a medium price this is a wonderful buy. but be ready to take time to establish connections and don't miss the update.   \n",
