    "***What exactly is web scraping?*** Web scraping is a sophisticated technique that enables the automatic retrieval and extraction of data from websites. In our case, it involves the parsing of the underlying HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) on web pages. Through this process, we gain the ability to capture specific information, be it plain text, captivating images, valuable links, or even intricate data like product reviews.\n",
